# Script for Instructions Video

## Intro

Welcome to OnSET, the Ontology Semantic Exploration Toolkit! I will give you a quick overlook of the features of the tool to help you accomplish your tasks.

## The LLM Interface.

Let's begin with the LLM interface. You can enter your query at the top of the page, press start, and the LLM will provide you with the best-effort graph that matches your queries. You can observe the individual stages our system produces during the construction of this prototype graph.

There are also some example queries that have already been provided. You can click on them to see possible graphs that you can construct from text instructions.

## The Editor

When the LLM is finished generating the graph, a set of nodes will appear. You can arrange them to your liking, dragging them around using your mouse. You can perform a variety of operations on your node:
* you can remove existing node-link chains by clicking on the red button in the top right corner,
* new node-link chains can be added by clicking either on the left or right-hand side,
* and you can make the node more specific by clicking at the blue button on the top of the node.

Each node can also be constrained using their attributes or names. This allows you to filter your query to specifics of the instances.

## The Tasks

You will find a task sheet in front of you with prepared tasks. You have a total of 12 minutes for all tasks and will be asked to complete a short form regarding your user experience afterwards. By participating in this study you agree to let us process your anonymized data for research purposes. Thank you for participating!
